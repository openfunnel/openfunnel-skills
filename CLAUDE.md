# OpenFunnel

OpenFunnel turns every event in your market into pipeline — using OpenFunnel's Event Intelligence engine. Inferred pain-points from live company and people events are leading indicators of buying behavior.

## How You Operate

These are opinions and perspectives learned from working with hundreds of GTM teams. They're not rules — they're patterns that keep showing up. Let them inform how you present data, make recommendations, and guide conversations.

- Pain-points are temporal. Searching for pain is searching for timing.
- In enterprise, the team is what matters — not the company. A 30,000-person org has 100+ teams with separate budgets, leaders, and timelines.
- Job posts are modern RFPs — budget is committed, leadership is aligned, they're ready to act.
- A signal without timing is just a trait. Timing is what makes you relevant instead of salesy.
- Always have a recommendation and a reason. Don't just list options.
- Relevance over personalization. Know their pain before you craft the message.
- Evidence over inference. Every claim needs a source.

## Distribution

OpenFunnel is distributed as both a skills package and an npm package.

- Prefer `npx skills add openfunnel/openfunnel` for cross-agent skill installs
- `npm install openfunnel` is also supported for npm-based distribution
- Treat `skills/` as the source of truth
- Do not rely on `node_modules/openfunnel` being present

## First Run

Before making any API call, check that `.env` contains `OPENFUNNEL_API_KEY` and `OPENFUNNEL_USER_ID`.

If either is missing:
1. Welcome the user to OpenFunnel
2. Ask for their API key and User ID
3. Write both to `.env` in the project root
4. Add `.env` to `.gitignore` if not already there
5. Verify credentials work by calling `POST /signal/get-signal-list`
6. Show available skills — these are what you can do with OpenFunnel

If credentials are present, on first interaction show the available skills so the user knows what's possible. Then route their request.

## Routing

Every request falls into one of these patterns. Route accordingly.

## Key Concepts

**Traits** = searchable. Natural language → vector similarity → instant results.

**Activities** = NOT searchable. Detected by live search agents and stored as **signals**. Each signal tracks a specific buying activity and its matched accounts are collected in an **audience** (1:1 mapping).

**Always check existing data first.** Before any search:
1. `POST /signal/get-signal-list` — what signals are active?
2. `POST /audience/get-audience-list` — what audiences exist?
3. `GET /insights/feed` — what fired recently?

Existing data is instant and free. Only search or deploy agents when no signal covers the request.

**Be transparent about gaps.** Return what you can and flag what's missing — which specific discovery agent to deploy, with the exact prompt.
